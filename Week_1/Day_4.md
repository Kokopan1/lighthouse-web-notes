## Introduction to AI

#### What is Artificial Intelligence
machine learning is a science that teaches machines from data to outputs
advanced algorithms that learns from your online interactions and collects data that provides you with more personalized outputs

Examples include
1. VA ie Siri or Alexa
2. fraud detection in banks
3. chatbots
4. navigation apps
5. social media advertising

What is AI
artifically incorporanted with human intelligence with algorithm and math

what does an AI do at its core?

Generalized learning --> doing the same things
Reasoning ability --> btw dicisions
Progblem solving by getting input and using the input to solve a problem.
Adapt, Reason, Provide solutions

Weak AI --> focuses soley on one task ie checkers but cant do anything else

Strong AI --> ie ultron from advengers --> is self aware and has its own personality

Machine learning is used to make AI. Deep learning is used to data and patterns can be better perseved.

Point of singularity--> AI as smart as humans



## Video 2 How will AI Change the World?

Problem with AI is that we give them fixed objectives but doesnt consider other factors like social norms ect... have to be VERY specific ie go get coffee but dont rob the store to get it. singular mindset regardless of the consequences to get the job accomplished, is psycopathic in nature

Technological unemployment ---> when machines do the work instead of people ie shipping distributions

General purpose AI --> when we use AI so much that we forget how to use/write/control AI b/c we will be infantized by AI letting them doing all the things for us

## Bias in AI

This happens because the people who creatd them or the data used for training had prejudiced assumptions ie Apple when they first rolled out face unlocking technology --> the data set used was all white people so POC had a harder time having their faces recognized to unlock the phone

Biased Training Data: AI models are typically trained on large datasets. If these datasets contain societal biases or incomplete information, AI models might learn and perpetuate those biases.

Data Imbalance: Sometimes, the AI is trained using sets of data that don't have equal representation for all groups.

Algorithm Design: The algorithms used in AI systems may inadvertently introduce bias based on their design. For example, an algorithm suggesting things to watch online might always prioritize popular content, which can amplify the existing biases and filter bubbles.

Human Involvement: Humans play a crucial role in developing and fine-tuning AI systems. Biases can be introduced at various stages, like when collecting data, setting up the rules, or deciding what's important.

Feedback Loops: AI systems that interact with users can learn from user behavior. If user interactions reflect biases (e.g., clicking on biased content), the AI can reinforce those biases over time.

Lack of Regulation: In some cases, AI development may occur without enough regulation to prevent bias. This can lead to the deployment of biased AI systems with harmful consequences.

Contextual Bias: AI systems may not account for the full context of a decision. For example, an AI system might fail to consider socioeconomic factors that influence an individual's creditworthiness.
